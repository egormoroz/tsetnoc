## Ideas
- max tries and various global tweaks are set via tags
- multiple concurrent contests
- live leaderboard + live attempt feed + can track selected opponents
- global contest (unlimited time, attempts, etc)
    - a general collection of problems
    - high quality new problems are introduced in local contests 
      (time/attempt limited), then added to global problem pool
    - some problems are scrapped, submitted by users/admins, 
      somehow generated, etc
        - these problems are rotated
        - if grading of problems by users is possible, only top-n problems 
          are kept, others are discarded? (unsure how to implement 
          proper grading, likely impossible)
        - otherwise, older problems are replaced by newer (maybe weighted 
          random, based on tags, % attempted/solved, etc)
    - UPD: probably no reason not to recycle old problems in contests
